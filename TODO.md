# Batch script
 - I'd rather not use a batch file at all. This would involve re-writing
 the data-vis stuff into python, or figuring out how to get R to do the data
 manipulation
 - I don't think I need a unix shell script, since I believe Waters instruments
 only run on Windows.

# 2D R script
 - Users should be able to define peaks to normalize the traces against
 - The script should produce 3 additional plots, each normalized to one of the
 three largest peaks.
